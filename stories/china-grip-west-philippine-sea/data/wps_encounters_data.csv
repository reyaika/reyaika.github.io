The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) vessel, BRP Cabra, promptly responded to a distress call from a Filipino fishing boat situated 70 nautical miles southwest of Silanguin Island, Zambales. Upon arrival, the fishermen faced heavy waves and utilized their indigenous boats to transport the PCG medical team for assistance. Unfortunately, the team discovered that the fisherman had no pulse and was already deceased.

To transport the body of the fisherman back to Subic, Zambales, BRP Cabra bravely navigated through the heavy waves to retrieve the deceased using its crane. It is crucial to note that the Chinese Coast Guard vessel CCG-3304, despite being aware of the distress call from the Filipino fishermen, engaged in shadowing that hindered the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) vessel’s efforts to recover the body.

The deployment of the PCG’s white ship underscores a commitment to monitoring and maintaining a visible presence to deter illegal activities by the Chinese Coast Guard while adhering to principles of restraint and non-provocation.","['https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gg8GHoxbIAA4waM?format=jpg&name=large', 'https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gg8GHovbAAA5CcA?format=jpg&name=large']",https://x.com/jaytaryela/status/1877739053573140616

The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) vessel, BRP Teresa Magbanua, has successfully conducted ongoing monitoring of the illegal presence of Chinese Coast Guard vessels exhibiting erratic movements along the coastline of Zambales Province, approximately 70-80 nautical miles from shore.

In a demonstration of their commitment to protecting the country’s maritime sovereignty, the crew of the BRP Teresa Magbanua persistently radio challenged the Chinese vessels, informing them that they are operating within the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The PCG referenced Republic Act 12064, the “Philippine Maritime Zones Act,” as well as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, of which China is a signatory, and the 2016 Arbitral Award. The crew made it clear that the Chinese vessels do not possess any legal authority to patrol within the Philippines’ EEZ and directed them to depart immediately.

Of particular note during today’s operations was the replacement of Chinese Coast Guard vessel 3103 by vessel 3304 in the afternoon. Despite this change, the objective of the Chinese deployment remains the same: to assert normalization and legitimacy in these waters. The PCG is steadfast in its mission to counteract these efforts and prevent any normalization of illegal deployment of CCG vessels.

Under the guidance of Commandant Admiral Ronnie Gil Gavan, the PCG will continue to vigilantly monitor the illegal presence of the Chinese Coast Guard while employing a measured response that prioritizes the Philippines’ national interests and aims to avoid escalation.","['https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gg2r3pSaMAMsYIt?format=jpg&name=large', 'https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gg2r3pUaMAMEbG_?format=jpg&name=large']",https://x.com/jaytaryela/status/1877346401669304768

Meanwhile, the PCG has tracked CCG-3103, which left Guangdong Province yesterday and is heading directly to the previous location of the monster ship.

As of 3 PM today, CCG-3103 was detected by Canada’s Dark Vessel Detection at a distance of 60 nautical miles from Pandaquit, Zambales. This indicates that CCG-3103 is likely serving as a replacement vessel for the monster ship, thereby sustaining its illegal presence within the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone.

The PCG Commandant, Admiral Ronnie Gil Gavan, has deployed the PCG Islander to the area, where it has confirmed the presence of CCG-3103 operating in the vicinity previously occupied by the monster ship. Additionally, the PCG vessel BRP Cabra is currently heading towards the location of CCG-3103 to monitor and challenge its presence.","['https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GgwenJ7aIAAcDqt?format=jpg&name=medium', 'https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GgwenJ6b0AA8NKn?format=jpg&name=large']",https://x.com/jaytaryela/status/1876908862378582365

Despite the PCG’s efforts to address the illegal presence of the CCG vessel through measured law enforcement operations, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) has provocatively deployed a People’s Liberation Army-Navy (PLA-N) helicopter, tail number 47, which hovered above the PCG vessel. In response, the PCG Commandant, Admiral Ronnie Gil Gavan has issued clear guidance to remain unthreatened and to refrain from actions that could escalate tensions.

The Philippine Coast Guard remains resolutely committed to safeguarding our sovereign rights and will not allow the presence of the Chinese Coast Guard vessel to infringe upon our maritime jurisdiction.

On its second day of patrol, the Philippine Coast Guard vessel BRP Cabra continues to actively monitor the movements of Chinese Coast Guard vessel 5901. The CCG vessel has been challenged regarding its illegal presence, emphasizing that it lacks the legal authority to operate within the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone. This radio challenge from the PCG is a response to claims made by the CCG vessel, which asserts it is conducting law enforcement duties within what it considers the jurisdictional waters of the People’s Republic of China.

To enhance safety and oversight of legitimate PCG maritime patrols, Commandant Admiral Ronniel Gil Gavan has deployed the PCG Islander to support these operations. This aircraft will document any potential incidents, including intentional ramming by the CCG vessel, and ensure that immediate rescue operations can be initiated if needed.

Despite the Chinese Coast Guard’s ongoing illegal presence approximately 65 to 70 nautical miles off the coast of Zambales, the PCG leadership remains unwavering in its commitment to a vigilant, rules-based, and peace-oriented approach. The PCG will continue to take deliberate and appropriately measured actions to challenge the illegal presence of the Chinese Coast Guard until it ceases its violations of the Philippines’ sovereign rights in these waters.

Throughout these monitoring efforts, the safety and security of Filipino fishermen remain the PCG’s highest priority.","['https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GgiGt0lbAAA4ahE?format=jpg&name=large', 'https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GgiGt0oacAAbx61?format=jpg&name=medium']",https://x.com/jaytaryela/status/1875897499904585749

Around noon yesterday, the agent of Harvest 89 notified the PCG of the vessel’s upcoming departure to its next port of call in San Felipe, Zambales, for dredging operations. However, when the PCG attempted to board the vessel for a Pre-Departure Inspection and to secure the Master’s Declaration of Safe Departure (MDSD), the agent denied entry, claiming that all necessary documentation was in order. This prompted personnel from the Coast Guard Substation in Limay, Bataan, to perform a more detailed inspection.

Upon boarding, the PCG composite team discovered nine undocumented Chinese crew members, all without proper documentation. Further investigations revealed that the crew manifest included only eight Filipino crew members. During a follow-up inspection, an additional four undocumented Chinese nationals were found hiding, bringing the total to thirteen.

The names of the undocumented Chinese nationals are:1. LUO XIAN MING, 30 June 1968, Age 562. JIANG HAI GNG, 08 July 1976, Age 483. CHEN YU, 06 May 1984, Age 404. ZHU ZHENGLI, 11 June 1965, Age 595.

The PCG acknowledges the unwavering patriotism, unshakeable bravery, dedication, and unparalleled professionalism of our personnel on board BRP Teresa Magbanua, as they carried out and performed their mission in Escoda Shoal even in dangerous and adverse operational conditions.

The PCG is firmly committed and determined in protecting the Philippines’ sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdiction in the West Philippine Sea, including in Escoda Shoal that lies well within the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 2016 Arbitral Award.",['https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GXfplwHbwAAXK50?format=jpg&name=large'],https://x.com/jaytaryela/status/1835192216618152200

“CCG ILLEGALLY BLOCKS PCG HUMANITARIAN MISSION”

Today, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) undertook a humanitarian mission involving the BRP Cabra and BRP Cape Engaño, aimed at delivering vital food and supplies to our personnel stationed aboard the BRP Teresa Magbanua, on extended patrol in Escoda Shoal.

Unfortunately, during this mission, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) deployed an excessive force comprised of a total of forty (40) vessels including six (6) Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) vessels, three (3) People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) warships, in an attempt to obstruct our lawful humanitarian operation. There were also thirty-one (31) Chinese Maritime Militia (CMM) Vessels in the vicinity waters of Escoda Shoal.

Such actions resulted in our two 44-meter Multi-Role Response Vessels (MRRV) being unable to safely deliver essential supplies, including a special ice cream treat from the Commandant in honor of National Heroes’ Day.

The PCG remains steadfast in our commitment to uphold national interests and ensure the safety and security of our waters. We urge the China Coast Guard to abide with the international law and stop deploying maritime forces that could undermine mutual respect, a universally recognized foundation for responsible and friendly relations among Coast Guards.

The PCG recognizes that white hulls are unique instruments of diplomacy that promotes peace and maintain harmony and stability in the region.",[],https://x.com/jaytaryela/status/1828077854539874574

The BFAR aircraft, Cessna 208B Grand Caravan, in coordination with the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), was tasked with monitoring and intercepting poachers encroaching upon the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the territorial seas of the maritime features constituting the Kalayaan Island Group. While the BFAR was conducting the routine patrol, the PRC unjustifiably deployed flares from Zamora Reef.

This same BFAR aircraft also faced harassment from the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) on August 19 during an MDA flight near Bajo de Masinloc. The PLAAF Chinese Fighter Jet 63270 engaged in irresponsible and dangerous maneuvers, deploying flares multiple times at a dangerously close distance of approximately 15 meters from the BFAR Grand Caravan aircraft. The Chinese fighter jet was not provoked, yet its actions demonstrated hazardous intent that jeopardized the safety of the personnel onboard the BFAR aircraft.

We firmly reiterate our call on the government of the People’s Republic of China to immediately cease all provocative and dangerous actions that threaten the safety of Philippine vessels and aircraft engaged in legitimate and regular activities within Philippine territory and Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the right of all vessels and aircraft exercising freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea. Such actions undermine regional peace and security, and further erode the image of the PRC with the international community.

The Philippines remains steadfast in exercising its right to strengthen maritime domain awareness within our sovereign territory, national airspace, and EEZ, as well as in the high seas, in accordance with United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the 2016 Arbitral Award.",['https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GVtYnLcawAAu4L9?format=jpg&name=medium'],https://x.com/jaytaryela/status/1827151634918732122

(Manila, 28 July 2024) – It is unfortunate that the MFA Spokesperson has mischaracterized the Philippines’ RORE mission yesterday morning.

Instead of acknowledging how two countries were able to manage differences in order to avoid miscalculation and misunderstanding, the Spokesperson chose to misrepresent what has been agreed between the Philippines and China regarding RORE missions in Ayungin Shoal.

Let us make it absolutely clear: the understanding between the Philippines and China was concluded in good faith, with the explicit agreement that it will not prejudice national positions. It is not helpful to keep giving false notions about what has been agreed on and how they were implemented.

The Philippines’ core positions on West Philippine Sea issues remain clear and consistent, including as regards our legally-settled maritime entitlements and our lawful right to conduct routine activities within our own exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The BRP Sierra Madre is a commissioned naval vessel and its presence in Ayungin Shoal is well within the Philippines’ sovereign rights and jurisdiction.

The Philippines will remain committed to the peaceful settlement of disputes, including through dialogue and consultation, and will honor the understanding on RORE missions. We expect China will also adhere to the understanding as negotiated.",['https://www.philembassy.org.nz/user/images/rt_reiko/2024/dfa-statement-20240728.jpg?66af69fb'],https://x.com/jaytaryela/status/1817477058630746465

The AFP used the civilian vessel ML Lapu-Lapu which was escorted by the PCG vessel BRP Cape Engaño (MRRV-4411). During the operation, various Chinese maritime forces were observed in the vicinity, including four (4) Chinese Coast Guard vessels, three (3) People’s Liberation Army-Navy vessels, and two (2) Chinese Maritime Militia vessels. During the entire duration of the mission, the Chinese vessels maintained their distance and did not undertake any action to disrupt the RORE. The successful execution of the RORE mission allowed the AFP to deliver essential supplies and provisions to the stationed personnel on the BRP Sierra Madre, while also rotating them with newly deployed troops. We recognize and commend the professionalism exhibited by the men and women of the Philippine Navy and the Philippine Coast Guard throughout the execution of mission. Their dedication, competence, and unwavering commitment to their duties have contributed to the successful outcome of the operation. The Philippines agreed to the “provisional understanding” with the PRC over the resupply missions to Ayungin Shoal for the simple reason of deescalating tensions and preventing misunderstanding and miscalculations at sea. The understanding explicitly does not prejudice the national position of the Philippines. The guidance of President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. is clear: The Philippines is committed to the cause of peace but we will not be deterred nor will we yield. We are, nonetheless, committed to address and manage difficult issues through dialogue and diplomacy. We fully expect China to adhere to the provisions of the “provisional understanding.” Both sides should deal with differences in a constructive manner and never through coercion and intimidation. To clarify, the Philippines did not and will never seek permission from the PRC to conduct resupply missions to Ayungin Shoal. There was also no boarding and inspection by the Chinese Coast Guard as claimed by the Chinese Foreign Ministry in its statement yesterday. Notwithstanding the “provisional understanding” with the PRC, the position of the Philippines is steadfast, unwavering, and has not changed. Ayungin Shoal is a low tide elevation not subject to sovereignty claims by the PRC as ruled by the Arbitral Tribunal in its 2016 Award. It falls within the Exclusive Economic Zone and continental shelf of the Philippines, therefore our continued presence and activities at the said shoal is lawful and legitimate as it is in accordance with international law, particularly UNCLOS. The National Task Force-West Philippine Sea remains steadfast in its commitment to safeguarding our sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction in the West Philippine Sea. We will continue to exercise and assert our maritime rights now and in the future.",['https://wpstransparency.ph/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/test-555x1024.png'],https://x.com/jaytaryela/status/1817412626185638032

During our attempt to bring the PCG HSRB alongside the PN RHIB at the rendezvous point, we were harassed by vessels and small boats from the China Coast Guard through blocking operations. Despite informing the Chinese Coast Guard via radio and public address system about the humanitarian nature of our mission for medical evacuation, they still engaged in dangerous maneuvers and even intentionally rammed the PN RHIB while transporting the sick personnel.

The barbaric and inhumane behavior displayed by the China Coast Guard has no place in our society. What should have been a simple medical evacuation operation was subjected to harassment, with the excessive deployment of two China Coast Guard vessels (21551 and 21555), two small boats, and two rubber boats. Their actions clearly demonstrated their intention to prevent the sick personnel from receiving the proper medical attention he urgently needed.

Despite the challenges posed by the interference from the CCG, the PN and PCG displayed remarkable cooperation, professionalism, and determination. They successfully outmaneuvered the numerous CCG assets and completed the transfer of the sick personnel, ensuring their safe arrival at Buliluyan Port.

We join Secretary Gilberto Teodoro in his call for the Department of Foreign Affairs to take appropriate actions against individuals in the Chinese Embassy who claim to have recorded an alleged phone conversation between a Chinese diplomat and a military official for violating Philippine laws, particularly the Anti-Wire Tapping Act, as well as for serious breaches of diplomatic protocols and conventions.

The Chinese Embassy’s repeated acts of engaging in and dissemination of disinformation, misinformation, and malinformation – now releasing spurious transcripts or recordings of purported conversations between officials of the host country – should not be allowed to pass unsanctioned or without serious penalty.

We emphasize that the unmistakable objective of the PRC embassy in its indiscriminate releasing of these falsehoods and smears have been, and continues to be, to sow discord, division, and disunity between and among the Filipino people.Without a doubt, these are serious breaches of the basic norms of international relations and diplomacy by the embassy.

Bypassing official and long established channels and protocols, talking to officials without the requisite authorities or bona fides, then maliciously claiming that alleged discussions should bind the PH government is farcical, foolish, and reckless.

Today is a sad day for Filipino fishermen. That China would go to great lengths to obstruct a Philippine humanitarian mission to assist our fishermen in their fishing grounds is not only shocking but appalling.

Earlier today, China Coast Guard (CCG) and Chinese Maritime Militia (CMM) vessels harassed, blocked, water cannoned, rammed vessels of the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) and the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) enroute to Panatag Shoal (Bajo de Masinloc) to conduct a regular humanitarian and assistance mission to Filipino Fishing Boats in and around the area.

In line with the transparency policy in the West Philippine Sea (WPS), members of the press – local and foreign – are routinely invited to embed in these regular BFAR Humanitarian and Assistance Missions for fisherfolk throughout the WPS and our other maritime areas. Today, the embedded press on the PCG and BFAR vessels have not only witnessed but also experienced first-hand – alongside the determined PCG and BFAR personnel – the illegal, coercive, aggressive, and dangerous actions of the agents of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and their CCG and CMM.

At this time, both PCG and BFAR vessels have regrouped approximately twenty (20) nautical miles from Panatag Shoal (Bajo de Masinloc). They are conducting damage assessments and are reorganizing.

Initial reports from PCG and BFAR personnel onboard, as reflected by live media reports, indicate that the PCG vessel suffered some damage to a part of its superstructure from targeted high-pressure water cannoning by CCG vessels. As regards the BFAR vessel, it sustained damage to its HVAC, electrical, navigation, and radio systems and superficial hull damage as the vessel was subjected to at least eight (8) instances of targeted high-pressure water cannoning from CCG vessels and was rammed a total of three (3) times by both CCG and CMM vessels.

These latest demonstrations of China’s illegal and irresponsible behavior highlight their egregious disregard for the Philippines’ lawful exercise of its rights and entitlements in our own EEZ. Clearly, China has no regard for the welfare of our fishermen who only want to make a decent living in the WPS. China’s act of obstructing civilian ships carrying only supplies for our fishermen calls into question the sincerity of their call for dialogue and peaceful approaches to de-escalate the situation in the West Philippine Sea.

The Philippines will continue to act peacefully and responsibly, consistent with a rules-based international law, on the basis of UNCLOS and the valid and binding 2016 Arbitral Award. Peace and stability in the region cannot be achieved if countries, big or small, do not exercise due regard for the well-established and legally-settled rights of others.

The Philippines will not be deterred from pursuing legitimate and lawful activities in our maritime zones, including in BDM which is a vital source of livelihood for our fisherfolk.",['https://wpstransparency.ph/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/test-631x1024.png'],https://x.com/jaytaryela/status/1785266956423286822

The primary objective of this mission was to distribute fuel and food supplies, highlighting our commitment to supporting the fishermen in accordance with the President’s food security policy.

During the patrol, the Philippine vessels encountered dangerous maneuvers and obstruction from four China Coast Guard vessels and six Chinese Maritime Militia vessels. At approximately 09:53, when the BFAR vessel was about 12 nautical miles from BDM, CCG-3305 utilized its water cannon, directly hitting the starboard astern of the BFAR vessel. When the PCG vessel was approximately 1000 yards east-southeast of BDM, CCG-3105 and CCG-5303 employed their jet stream water cannons, targeting the PCG vessel from both sides, resulting in damage to the railing and canopy. This damage serves as evidence of the forceful water pressure used by the China Coast Guard in their harassment of the Philippine vessels.

It is important to note that the Chinese Coast Guard has once again installed a 380-meter floating barrier that covers the entire entrance of the shoal, effectively restricting access to the area.

Despite the harassment and provocative actions of the Chinese Coast Guard, both the PCG and BFAR vessels stood their ground and continued their maritime patrol.

The Philippines welcomes the G7 Foreign Ministers’ reiteration of their collective commitment to the rule of law and to the rules-based maritime order anchored on the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), as well as their commitment to sustainable and inclusive economic development as expressed in their “Statement on Addressing Global Challenges, Fostering Partnership” issued on 19 April 2024 in Capri, Italy.

The Philippines is firmly committed to UNCLOS and the binding Arbitral Award of 2016. Respect for international law, particularly for the recognized maritime entitlements of coastal states in the South China Sea and the freedom of navigation enjoyed by the international community, is essential to ensuring global prosperity, peace and stability. These are fundamental values that benefit not only the Indo-Pacific region, but the wider community of nations.

As such, we appreciate the G7’s support in rejecting China’s baseless and expansive claims, and their call for China to cease its illegal activities, particularly its use of coast guard and maritime militia in the South China Sea that engage in dangerous maneuvers and the use of water cannons against Philippine vessels. We duly note and appreciate the G7’s reaffirmation that the 2016 Arbitral Award is a significant milestone and a useful basis for the peaceful management and resolution of differences at sea.

The Philippines shares the G7’s vision of a stable and secure Indo-Pacific region, and stands firm against any actions that undermine international security and stability.

We want to see a South China Sea of peace, stability and prosperity, and the cessation of interference, obstruction and harassment of the Philippines’ legal activities within our recognized maritime entitlements.

The Philippines is keen to see an inclusive and economically dynamic Indo-Pacific that benefits the region’s peoples. We welcome the G7’s economic initiatives, particularly investments within the framework of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, and its recognition of the strategic importance of the Luzon Economic Corridor in driving inclusive and sustainable development. We stand ready to cooperate with the G7 in its efforts to support economic growth in the Philippines and the Indo-Pacific.

Finally, the Philippines takes note of the various global challenges identified by the G7 statement and underscores its readiness to positively contribute to the collective efforts of the international community to address them.","['https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GLqHrO1bMAExOX0?format=jpg&name=medium', 'https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GLqHrOza8AA3X5h?format=jpg&name=medium']",https://x.com/jaytaryela/status/1781885790324408746

The persistent discourse about alleged, unsubstantiated or imaginary promises; of secret non-binding gentleman agreement or deals has been used to create distractions, divisions, and conflict among our people.

The President has been very clear: This administration is not aware of any secret or gentleman agreement and if there was such done under a previous administration, the same has been rescinded.

Moreover, any such agreement, if proven to be true, are inimical to the national interest and the Constitution. If there is any such agreement, it is the responsibility of those responsible for it to explain it before the Filipino people but it is not and will never be binding upon this administration.

We call on all Filipinos to stand their ground and push back against these malign and corrosive narratives that seek to undermine the national interest.

Although they have not directly obstructed or interfered with our survey activities, this relentless behavior serves as undeniable evidence that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is unhesitant in deploying its vessels within our Exclusive Economic Zone to intimidate and impede our legitimate operations, specifically in the field of marine scientific research.

This blatant disregard for our jurisdiction and sovereign rights directly refutes the false narratives that are being propagated by Pro-China trolls. These individuals falsely claim that our actions are intended to provoke China or that we deliberately seek to present ourselves as oppressed. Per the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea’s (UNCLOS) Part XIII, the Philippines has the exclusive right to regulate, authorize, and conduct marine scientific research in its own EEZ and Continental Shelf. It is crucial to emphasize that our ongoing hydrographic survey in the northern region fully aligns with this provision. As a nation, we have every right to conduct this survey without facing impediments from any other states.

Furthermore, it is noteworthy that despite the provocative presence of the China Coast Guard vessel, we have chosen not to respond with violence or aggression. Nevertheless, the government remains committed to advancing the rule of law in the West Philippine Sea and peace in the broader Indo-Pacific Region.

The Chinese Coast Guard vessels went as far as pretending to man their water cannons and threatening the Filipino fishermen, demonstrating China’s unlawful behavior aimed at depriving the Filipinos of their rights to access the resources in our Exclusive Economic Zone.

The Philippine Embassy in Beijing has also been instructed to lodge the same demarche with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

In these demarches, the Philippines stressed, among others, that China has no right to be in Ayungin Shoal, a low-tide elevation that lies within the Philippines exclusive economic zone and continental shelf in accordance with the 1982 UNCLOS and as affirmed by the 2016 Arbitral Award.

China’s continued interference with the Philippines’ routine and lawful activities in its own exclusive economic zone is unacceptable. It infringes upon the Philippines sovereign rights and jurisdiction. The Philippines demands that Chinese vessels leave the vicinity of Ayungin Shoal and the Philippine exclusive economic zone immediately.

The Philippines has made sincere efforts to implement the instruction of President Marcos and President Xi to lower tensions. China’s aggressive actions call into question its sincerity in lowering the tensions and promoting peace and stability in the South China Sea. Even as the Philippines continues to engage China in dialogue and diplomacy at the bilateral and multilateral levels, China’s aggressive actions contradict and put to waste ASEAN-China efforts to promote practical activities to foster peace and cooperation in the region.

China CoastGuard (CCG) and Chinese Maritime Militia (CMM) vessels once again harassed, blocked, deployed water cannons, and executed dangerous maneuvers against the routine RoRe mission that led to significant damage to the supply vessel and causedinjury to personnel.

Their reckless and dangerous actions culminated with the water cannoning of UM4 causing severe damage to the vessel and injuries to Filipinos onboard. PCG vessels MRRV 4407 and 4409 broke through CCG and CCM attempts to obstruct themand provided immediate relief and assistance to the disabled UM4 and her crew.

These features appeared and were clearly identified in the administrative maps of the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period, including the 1734 Murillo Velarde Map of the Philippines.

As has been settled by the 2016 Arbitral Award, China’s claims to historic rights, or other sovereign rights or jurisdiction beyond the limits of the maritime entitlements provided by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), are without legal effect.

The Philippines maintains a firm stand against misguided claims and irresponsible actions that violate Philippine sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdiction in its own maritime domain.

The systematic and consistent manner in which the People’s Republic of China carries out these illegal and irresponsible actions puts into question the sincerity of its calls for peaceful dialogue and lessening of tensions.

The Philippines, for its part, continues to act peacefully and responsibly, consistent with international law, particularly UNCLOS and the legally binding 2016 Arbitral Award. Peace and stability cannot be achieved without due regard for the legitimate, well-established, and legally settled rights of others.

The Philippines will not be deterred from exercising our legal rights over our maritime zones, including Ayungin Shoal which forms part of our Exclusive Economic Zone and continental shelf.

The Philippines rejects China’s assertion that joint patrols with US forces in the WestPhilippine Sea constitute stirring up trouble. Our engagements with the United Statesare well within our rights as a sovereign and independent nation, aimed at promotingmaritime security and upholding international law. We reject any assertion from other countries that seeks to undermine our legal and legitimate activities.

The joint air patrol or exercise conducted by the Philippine Air Force (PAF) and theUnited States Pacific Air Force (PACAF) is a lawful and routine exercise aimed atenhancing interoperability between allied forces and promoting regional peace andsecurity in the Indo-Pacific region.

The joint patrols conducted inside Philippine territory serve the purpose of enhancingmaritime security, promoting regional stability, and upholding international law.These patrols help deter illegal activities, ensure freedom of navigation, andcontribute to the protection of shared interests in the region.

International law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea(UNCLOS), recognizes the sovereign rights of coastal states. We urge China to respect the sovereign rights of the Philippines conducted within its territory consistent with its national interests and international law.

Adhering to established legal frameworks is crucial for fostering peaceful relations,stability, and cooperation between the Philippines and China. Adherence tointernational norms are essential to the peaceful coexistence of neighboring states. Respecting and following international law is essential for maintaining peace,resolving disputes, and advancing our shared interests in the region.

The joint air patrol with the US is part of our longstanding defense cooperation.

Eduardo M. Año on thePhilippines’ Rotational Deployment of PCG and BFAR Vessels in Bajo De Masinloc (BDM)

In line with the vision of “Bagong Pilipinas” in achieving food security as a pivotal element in national development, the Philippine government has taken decisive action to protect the rights and safety of Filipino fishermen in the waters of Bajo De Masinloc (BDM). The national government has directed the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) and Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) to deploy their vessels for rotational deployment in BDM starting this month.

The PCG vessel, BRP Teresa Magbanua (MRRV-9701), recently completed a successful nine-day patrol from 01-09 February 2023. Meanwhile, the BFAR vessel, BRP Datu Tamblot (MMOV-3005), has been conducting patrols in the waters of BDM since February 14, 2024 and continues to do so at present. These efforts aim to ensure the safety and security of our Filipino fishermen in their traditional fishing grounds. Further, both PCG and BFAR were also directed to distribute food packs, groceries, and even fuel to support the fishermen in sustaining their activities in the vicinity of BDM.

There is no truth to the statement of the Chinese Coast Guard that it expelled a BFAR vessel and PCG vessel that allegedly intruded into their waters. The National Security Council reaffirms the Philippines’ sovereign rights and jurisdiction over Bajo de Masinloc and it’s surrounding waters within the Philippine Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). These rights are recognized under international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the 2016 Arbitral Award.

It is crucial to emphasize that the activities of the Filipino fishermen and the PCG and BFAR vessels in BDM are fully compliant with national laws and consistent with the Philippines’ position on the West Philippine Sea. Any attempts by state actors to intimidate or drive away our fishermen are clear violations of international law and disregard the decision of the Arbitral Award.

Despite these challenges, the PCG and BFAR vessels will maintain professionalism in dealing with any unlawful and provocative behavior exhibited by China Coast Guard and the Chinese Maritime Militia vessels. This includes responding to dangerous and blocking maneuvers that blatantly disregard the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (COLREGs).

The National Task Force on the West Philippine Sea (NTFWPS) reassures the Filipino people that our member agencies are fully dedicated to upholding our commitment to the President and the nation. Through a comprehensive whole-of-government approach, we stand unwavering in our mission to protect our sovereignty and safeguard our national interests in the West Philippine Sea.",['https://mirror.pia.gov.ph/uploads/2024/01/527227e9455fd0ba54dc1ee678afb107-800-1200.jpg'],https://x.com/jaytaryela/status/1758356516242137475

On February 1, 2024 the deployment of the vessel was ordered by CG Admiral Ronnie Gil Gavan, Commandant of the Philippine Coast Guard, to ensure the safety of Filipino fishermen in the area and to safeguard them from further harassment.

The Philippines has sovereignty over Bajo De Masinloc and its territorial sea, and sovereign rights and jurisdiction over the surrounding waters falling within the Philippine Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) as measured from the Philippine archipelagic baselines, in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the 2016 Arbitral Award.  The activities of the Filipino fisherfolk and of the PCG in the area are consistent with national laws and the Philippines’ position on the West Philippine Sea (WPS).

Throughout the patrol, the PCG vessel closely monitored and supported a total of 100 Filipino Fishermen in 14 Filipino Fishing Boats. The PCG crew distributed food packs and groceries to assist the fishermen in their activities in the vicinity of Bajo De Masinloc, a traditional fishing ground for Filipino fisherfolk. The Filipino fishermen expressed gratitude to the national government, emphasizing that the presence of the PCG vessel enhances their confidence to continue fishing in Bajo de Masinloc.

Over the course of the nine-day patrol, the PCG vessel monitored the presence of four Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) vessels with bow numbers 3105, 3302, 3063, and 3064. These CCG vessels shadowed the PCG vessel on more than 40 occasions, with the closest distance being 176 meters from its side. The CCG vessels performed dangerous and blocking maneuvers at sea against BRP Teresa Magbanua four times, with the CCG vessels crossing the bow of the PCG vessel twice, recklessly disregarding the “Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea”(COLREGS) once again. Additionally, the PCG vessel observed the presence of four Chinese Maritime Militia vessels.

Nevertheless, the PCG vessel professionally engaged both the CCG and CMM vessels through radio reiterating the clear and principled position of the Philippines in accordance with international law.

The Philippine Coast Guard assures the public that we will remain steadfast in our commitment to the President and the Filipino nation. The white hulls of the PCG will consistently ensure the safety and welfare of Filipino fishermen, supporting the vision of “Bagong Pilipinas” in achieving food security as a pivotal element in national development.",[],https://x.com/jaytaryela/status/1756526553520083343

AÑOON THE RECENT OCTA RESEARCH SURVEY RESULTSManila, Philippines | 24 January 2024

We welcome the findings of the Tugon ng Masa Fourth Quarter survey conducted by OCTA Research, which sheds light on the sentiments of the Filipino people regarding the West Philippine Sea (WPS) issue.

The survey, conducted last month among 1,200 adult respondents, has revealed that a significant majority of 72% believe that the Marcos administration should assert the country’s territorial rights in the WPS through military action, specifically through expanded naval patrols and troop presence in the area.

Consistent with the views of the people, we are prioritizing the modernization of the armed forces and the coast guard with the acquisition of the latest state-of-the-art assets in order to achieve credible defense. We have also stepped up maritime and air patrols in the area as well as conducted maritime cooperation activities and exercises with the United States and with other countries in the future.

We acknowledge the importance of understanding the public sentiment and values the democratic process that allows the Filipino people to express their views on matters of national significance. We note that the WPS issue is of great concern to the public, as evidenced by the respondents’ strong preference for a robust approach to safeguarding the country’s territorial integrity.

It is essential to recognize the diversity of opinions reflected in the survey, with 70% of respondents expressing the belief that the issue should also be addressed through diplomacy and other peaceful methods. We emphasize the importance of considering a comprehensive national strategy that encompasses both military and diplomatic efforts to secure and protect the nation’s interests in the WPS.

We reiterate the commitment of the Marcos administration to prioritize the welfare and security of the Filipino people. The government will carefully evaluate the survey results, taking into account the multifaceted nature of the WS issue, to formulate policies that align with the collective aspirations of the nation.

We encourage continued engagement and discourse on matters related to national security, emphasizing the importance of unity in addressing challenges and securing a prosperous future for the Philippines.","['https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GEmLXRLaoAAxrDN?format=jpg&name=large', 'https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GEmLXRPboAAYD7V?format=jpg&name=large']",https://x.com/jaytaryela/status/1750083182555521329

We have taken note of the recent statements from the Chinese Foreign Ministry expressing concerns about the joint maritime cooperative activities conducted by the Philippines and the United States in the West Philippine Sea. The Chinese spokesman referred to these activities as “provocative military activities” and deemed them as “irresponsible.”

We wish to clarify that the joint maritime activities between the Philippines and the United States were clearly conducted within our exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and are consistent with international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), so how can they be deemed provocative?

The Philippines is merely exercising its sovereign right to engage in such activities within its territory and these exercises are aimed at enhancing our maritime capabilities and interoperability with the US which is a treaty partner to ensure the security and stability of the region. The joint patrol emphasizes our ability to work seamlessly together to ensure the readiness of our joint forces to address evolving security challenges.

Our joint patrols with the United States and potential future activities with other allied countries shows our mutual commitment to a rules-based international order and for promoting peace and stability of the region.

It also demonstrates the significant improvement in the Philippine’s defense capabilities and the development of a world-class navy and armed forces capable of carrying out its mandate to defend the territorial integrity of the Philippines and our maritime rights in the West Philippine Sea.

The Philippines remains open to diplomatic discussions with China and reaffirms its commitment to fostering good relations with all nations. We believe that through peaceful dialogue and adherence to international law, we can achieve a resolution that serves the best interests of all parties involved in the region.",['https://wpstransparency.ph/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1-1-763x1024.png'],https://x.com/jaytaryela/status/1743243288151249223

On August 5, 2023, China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels engaged in aggressive behavior by executing dangerous maneuvers and using water cannons against PCG vessels, which were escorting indigenous boats commissioned by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP).

Commodore Tarriela highlighted the importance of national loyalty in light of these developments, urging Filipinos to stand together in defending the country’s interests. While acknowledging the significance of free speech, he cautioned against its misuse to justify actions that may harm national unity. He concluded by reiterating that the resources of the West Philippine Sea are intended for the Filipino people:

“”Dahil sa West Philippine Sea, ang yaman nito ay para sa Pilipino!””

The appeal for unity aligns with ongoing efforts by the Philippines to peacefully manage territorial disputes in the area, balancing diplomacy with proactive defense measures.1

The Malapascua was on a maritime patrol, accompanied by the BRP Malabrigo, when they were reportedly shadowed by Chinese navy and coast guard vessels, which ordered them to leave the area several times. This incident mirrors a similar confrontation in June when CCG vessels executed dangerous maneuvers against PCG ships in the same region. The Philippine government has consistently raised diplomatic protests against China’s alleged harassment of Filipino fishermen and incursions within the WPS, citing the threat these actions pose to Philippine sovereignty and maritime safety.

At the core of the dispute is China’s assertion of sovereignty over large parts of the South China Sea, marked by the so- called nine-dash line. This claim overlaps with the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and other countries’ maritime zones. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague ruled that China’s nine-dash line claim has no legal basis and upheld the rights of Filipino fishermen to operate in the disputed waters. However, China has rejected this ruling and continues to assert control in the area through guard and maritime militia operations.

The Philippine government has sought diplomatic and multilateral support, underscoring the importance of freedom of navigation and rule of law in the South China Sea. However, the persistent confrontations indicate ongoing challenges in enforcing the 2016 arbitral ruling and managing the complex geopolitical tensions in the region.",[],

These buoys were positioned around four critical islands: Lawak Island, Likas Island, Parola Island, and Pag-asa Island. The installation ceremony was led by PCG Commandant, Admiral Artemio M. Abu, emphasized the importance of these navigational markers, describing them as “symbols of coastal state administration” that will aid maritime navigation and enhance safety for sailors navigating the often-treacherous WPS waters. The buoys were installed by a fleet of five Coast Guard vessels—the BRP Corregidor (AE-891), BRP Bojeador (AE-46), BRP Suluan (MRRV-4406), BRP Capones (MRRV-4404), and Tug Boat Habagat (TB- 271)—during operations conducted from 12 to 14 May 2022.

This initiative is a reflection of the PCG’s broader mandate, which encompasses various functions, including maritime safety, law enforcement, and environmental protection. The newly installed buoys serve as vital navigational aids, providing guidance for sailors traversing these treacherous waters, especially at night when the buoys emit flashing lights. This enhancement of navigational safety aligns with the PCG’s role in preventing maritime accidents and ensuring the safety of life at sea.

According to Admiral Abu, these buoys also signify the establishment of special protected zones where resource-extractive activities like mining and oil exploration are prohibited, aimed at preserving the WPS’s rich natural resources. This aspect of the installation underscores the PCG’s commitment to environmental protection as part of its mandate.The successful deployment of the buoys was facilitated by a collaborative effort involving various PCG units, including notable vessels such as BRP Corregidor, BRP Bojeador, and others. This demonstrates the PCG’s capability to coordinate complex operations across multiple units, a critical function in maintaining sovereignty and presence in the region. During his assessment visit to Pag-asa Island, Admiral Abu noted the peaceful coexistence of Filipino fishing bancas alongside foreign vessels, including those from Vietnam and China. He highlighted how respect was maintained during this operation, reinforcing the PCG’s role in enforcing maritime laws and upholding the Philippines’ territorial rights.

Looking to the future, Admiral Abu announced plans for the installation of additional navigational buoys in other parts of the country’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ), particularly in WPS and Benham Rise. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to enhance maritime safety and solidify the PCG’s presence in critical areas. The installation of these navigational buoys not only emphasizes the PCG’s vital functions in maritime safety and environmental protection but also symbolizes national pride and sovereignty in the ever-evolving maritime landscape of the West Philippine Sea.",[],
